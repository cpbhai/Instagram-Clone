**What i used to create**
> 1. I have used **NodeJS**, **MongoDB**, **Express**, **React** for the backend and the frontend .
> 2. For the authentication: i have used a package called **jsonwebtoken**
> 3. For user's credentials safety, i have used a package **bcryptjs**, which coverts user's password from plain text to **Hashed**.
> 4. For a good design, i have used a package called material-css.
